    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These Buffalo chicken pizza rolls are filling little rolls—the perfect bite-sized appetizer or snack. The Buffalo sauce, chicken, and cheese ratio is ideal; it's not too saucy or overly spicy. The ranch butter brushed overtop adds another layer of herbaceous flavor that's a new spin on a classic combo.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup shredded cooked chicken</li>
        <li>2 ounces low-moisture part-skim mozzarella cheese, shredded (about 1/2 cup)</li>
        <li>2 1/2 tablespoons Buffalo-style hot sauce (such as Frank’s® RedHot)</li>
        <li>1 (13.8 ounce) can refrigerated pizza crust dough (such as Pillsbury®)</li>
        <li>nonstick cooking spray</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ranch dressing mix</li>
        <li>ranch dressing or blue cheese dressing, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Stir chicken, mozzarella, and hot sauce together in a small bowl until well combined; set aside.</li>
        <li>Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface to a 6x20-inch rectangle using a rolling pin. Cut dough into 8 3x5-inch rectangles.</li>
        <li>Brush edges of dough lightly with water. Place 1 tablespoon chicken mixture in the center of each rectangle. Roll dough over filling to form a 3 1/2x1 1/2-inch log. Pinch sides to seal. Transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) for 2 minutes. Lightly coat the air fryer basket with cooking spray. Working in batches, place pizza rolls around edges of air fryer basket in 1 layer, and cook until golden brown, about 7 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>While pizza rolls are cooking, stir together melted butter and ranch dressing mix in a small bowl. Brush cooked pizza rolls with seasoned butter. Serve with ranch dressing, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
